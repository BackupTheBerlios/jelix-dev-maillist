Hi,

Here is a summary of the unofficial Jelix Summit at Paris Web 2008.

When : 2008-11-13
Where : Quick Restaurant ;)
Who : bastnic, laurentj, loic_m



* Jelix 1.1 :

  - we want to release 1.1 as sooner as possible


* Jelix > 1.1 :

We need to provide a real "dev edition", this means :

  - adding logs (coordinator, selector calls, jDb, ...) to help debug.
See ticket #175
  - adding a dev toolbar to see those logs. This bar could be hidden but
not deactivable in the conf. So as the dev edition won't be use in
production anymore.
  - by default dev edition should display the backtrace for errors, and
if possible with a nice display (in the toolbar ?)
  - compilation must be set to force = on (performance doesn't matter
une developpment)

Others :

  - work on install/deinstall/update components (plugins, modules, ...)
  - work on the doc : french + english. We should release the first
official edition of the Jelix book in pdf
  - as explained by the Y! Exceptionnal Performances Team, we could
provide an enhancement with jResponseHtml in order to put the JS links
at the bottom of the page (significant gain in the perception of speed
while loading pages)
  - jResponseHtml too: we could provide a way to minify and merge JS
files and CSS files in order to decrease the number of HTTP requests and
the total size of the files. Resulting optimized files would be cached.


* Around Jelix :

  - work on sharecode
  - work on jbugtracker and use it for Jelix
  - migrating to mercurial ?
  - having a new really nice design for Jelix sites


It was nice meeting you guys !

Thanks for the report and great to hear from you...

Just adding my thougths on the roadmap :
As for 1.1 planning, here is a wishlist of what I'll try to work on and 
hope to get  in. As jelix 1.1 was really about jForms :
- jqueryfying jforms_jquery.js
- implementing CSRF security (#478)

As for post1.1 planning and the focus on performance, I would add work 
on a cache management system. I have gathered some thoughts and usefuls 
links. I'll try to start a draft on the wiki sooner than later, also 
summering/gathering efforts already done (cache coord plugin proposed by 
hadrien[OB],  jCache by sylvain261)

Message-ID: <492D18A7.5070007@jelix.org>

Hello,

I would like to release Jelix 1.1RC1 next week ! Yessss !

So, only bugs fix are allowed in the trunk until next week. Patch for 
new features  will be include only for Jelix 1.2. (except ticket #196; 
Julien, I'm waiting after a new version of your patch :-))

After the release of Jelix 1.1 RC1, I will create the 1.1.x branch, so 
we could then land patch for 1.2 in the trunk.

Help needed on the french documentation. See 
http://developer.jelix.org/report/15

help needed also to update the english manual 
http://jelix.org/articles/en/manual-1.1

Go Go Go ! :-D

Laurent
