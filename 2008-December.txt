Subject: [Jelix-dev] Release of Jelix 1.1RC1
Message-ID: <493DAE37.3070404@jelix.org>

Hello !

This is done ! The first release candidate is here !

http://jelix.org/en/news/post/jelix-1.1RC1-is-available
http://jelix.org/fr/news/post/jelix-1.1RC1-est-disponible

We have still many work on the documentation. Please help me to finish 
the french and the english manuals.

After the release of Jelix 1.1, the english documentation will become 
the main documentation, so the priority will be the english 
documentation. We really need to target non-french developers, in order 
to have more and more contributors.


Thanks by advance,

Laurent
