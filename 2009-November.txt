Message-ID: <4B12EF66.1090909@jelix.org>

Hello,

We have now a new server, and the migration from the old server begin 
this evening and will end perhaps next saturday.

So this week, you may know difficulties to access to the web sites and 
other services (hg, svn...).

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Laurent

Hi,

first step for the migration: the mercurial repositories. So there are 
closed for committers (impossible to commit). However you could still 
clone them.

hg repositories have been migrated. the new http://hg.jelix.org is up. 
Just wait for DNS propagation to access to the new home of repositories, 
where you can push your commits.

verify that in your .hg/hgrc file, in your all local repositories, for 
the default path, you have the hg.jelix.org domain name, and not 
jelix.org (jelix.org still points to the old server). for example, for a 
clone of jelix-trunk, you should have

[paths]
default = http://hg.jelix.org/jelix/jelix-trunk

or for commiters

[paths]
default = ssh://hg at hg.jelix.org/jelix/jelix-trunk

If this is not the case, edit the hgrc file.


All files for download.jelix.org have also been migrated, and the new 
http://download.jelix.org is up.

Subject: [Jelix-dev] Release of Jelix 1.1.5
Message-ID: <4B094DC9.20907@xulfr.org>

Hello,

I just released jelix 1.1.5, because of an anoying warning which appears 
when we use 1.1.4 with PHP 5.3.

I fixed also other minor bugs. We have now only one known bug on stable 
branches :-)
