Subject: [Jelix-dev] Jelix moved to Github
Message-ID: <4E54EB51.3010304@jelix.org>

Dear contributors,

As you may know, the project has been moved to github 
https://github.com/jelix/jelix/

You can read why here: 
http://jelix.org/en/news/post/let-s-move-to-git-and-github

Rules to commit have changed a bit.

Except to fix some syntax issues, misspelling or tiny changes, don't 
commit directly on this repository (for those who have write access). 
You are strongly encouraged to fork the repository in your github 
account, and commit your changes into this fork.

Then you will have to do a "pull request". It allows us to review your 
changes in github, and when all is ok, to integrate your changes easily 
into the official repository.

If you want to propose several different changes, create a branch for 
each changes, so we could integrate changes individually, depending of 
their "review status". With Git, when your changes will be integrated, 
you could "delete" the corresponding branch in your fork.

As usual, let's discuss on the forum or on the mailing-list of your 
proposition of improvement/bug fix before you code it, especially if 
this is a critical change, an API change or a big/complex change. You 
will have more chance  to see them imported in the official repository :-)

For the code review, I think that everyone (who have a github account) 
could comment and review pull requests. So don't hesitate to review 
changes! I don't want to be anymore the single reviewer :-)

The submission of patch into tickets on developer.jelix.org is now a 
"deprecated" way to contribute; I prefer to work now with Github.

However for the moment, use developer.jelix.org to indicate 
bugs/improvements, although you can use the github issues manager of the 
project. The use of the github issues manager is still under study (what 
about of its feature, how to migrate tickets etc...). We probably 
migrate to it but no decision has been made for now.

If you have suggestion, don't hesitate to let me know.

I want a project management more flexible.

Fork it, fork it, fork it!

Laurent

As I'm reading this nice post 
http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/ I have a notice 
to do.

about "create a branch for each changes"
that mean we have to do first of all :
1) git clone git at github:myaccount/jelix

then create a branch for our feature/fix, on the _target_ branch from 
which we want to submit a patch
2) git checkout -b ticket_1234_subject_foobar jelix-1.2.x
where jelix-1.2.x is the _target_ branch

3) when the patch will be reviewed we could delete the branch by :
3.1) point on the right _target_ branch
git checkout jelix-1.2.x
3.2) merge the feature
git merge --no-ff ticket_1234_subject_foobar
3.3) delete the "branch" of the feature/fix
git branch -d ticket_1234_subject_foobar
3.4) push
git push origin jelix-1.2.x


Is all of that correct ?

Olivier.
